    is a dotnet tool for checking and upgrading versions of
    <a href="https://nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a> packages. For NodeJS
    projects I like to use
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates" target="_blank"
      >npm-check-updates</a
    >
    and not the built in npm update command. But why? Simple. I want to directly
    see in the package.json file which versions are installed. NCU does exactly
    that, it changes the versions in the package.json file.

    When I started to learn C# I was searching for something similar over at
    <a href="https://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank">nuget.org</a> but could not
    find anything. So I thought building such a
    <a
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools-how-to-create"
      >dotnet tool</a
    >
    would be a nice way for exploring C#. After I built
    <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PackCheck" target="_blank"
      >PackCheck</a
    >
    and published it to NuGet I found out about the
    <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-outdated-tool"
      >dotnet-outdated-tool</a
    >
    ðŸ¤ª.
